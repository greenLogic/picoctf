The string in hex to convert is 0x070.

Is possible convert it with online services like [RapidTables](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-ascii.html). But we are doing it using just bash commands:

Using printf:

printf '\x70'

Now with echo:

echo -e "\x70"

And now dumping it with xxd:

echo 70 | xxd -r -p

Please look that the string dropped the 0 that is front of the 70.

The ASCII equivalent is the letter p.

Thus the flag is: 

picoCTF{p}

I read this post of the [Baeldung blog](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/character-hex-to-ascii). I recommend you to check it out.
