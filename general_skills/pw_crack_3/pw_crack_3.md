Download the password checker here and you'll need the encrypted flag and the hash in the same directory too.
There are 7 potential passwords with 1 being correct. You can find these by examining the password checker script.

Hints
1. To view the level3.hash.bin file in the webshell, do: $ bvi level3.hash.bin
2. To exit bvi type :q and press enter.
3. The str_xor function does not need to be reverse engineered for this challenge.
